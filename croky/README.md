# Cruky

croky is a server-side library for the dart ecosystem to help you create your API as fast as possible. Cruky team want to make server-side apps with modern style and fast high performance.

The main reason why croky was built, because all libraries are focused on the Flutter ecosystem and not on dart language and this makes the library have fewer futures than other frameworks or libraries like (Django, FastAPI, ROR, ..etc) So croky team decided that we will make a new library that focuses on Dart and get the maximum performance using dart mirrors and code generators together to get the best usage of the dart.
